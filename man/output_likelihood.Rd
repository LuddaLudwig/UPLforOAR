\title{Organizes mcmc output from run_likelihood()}
\usage{
output_likelihood(jags_model_run, significance = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{jags_model_run}{The output list returned from run_likelihood(),
which includes the jags model 'run_results', likelihood distribution type,
and data, xvals, and future_tests used as inputs to run_likelihood()}

\item{significance}{Level of significance from 0 to 1, the default is 0.99.}
}
\value{
A list including 'distr' the distribution used in write_likelihood(),
the 'predicted_mean' the mean of the fitted distribution, 'UPL_Bayes' the
upper predictive limit based on the 'significance' level and average
distribution of 'future_tests' number of draws, 'obs_pdf' the predicted
probability density at each observation, and 'pred_pdf' the predicted
probability density at each point in xvals.
}
\description{
'output_likelihood() takes the jags_model_run produced by run_likelihood(),
merges the mcmc chains and calculates the UPL as well as
providing the predicted pdf.
