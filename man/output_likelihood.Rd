\title{Organizes mcmc output from \code{\link[=run_likelihood]{run_likelihood()}}}
\usage{
output_likelihood(jags_model_run, significance = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{jags_model_run}{The output list returned from \code{\link[=run_likelihood]{run_likelihood()}},
which includes the jags model \code{run_results}, likelihood distribution type,
and \code{data}, \code{xvals}, and \code{future_runs} used as inputs to \code{\link[=run_likelihood]{run_likelihood()}}.}

\item{significance}{Level of significance from 0 to 1, the default is \code{0.99}.}
}
\value{
A list including \code{distr}, the distribution used in \code{\link[=write_likelihood]{write_likelihood()}},
\code{predicted_mean}, the mean of the fitted distribution, \code{UPL_Bayes}, the
upper predictive limit based on the \code{significance} level and average
distribution of \code{future_runs} number of draws, \code{obs_pdf}, the predicted
probability density at each observation, and \code{pred_pdf}, the predicted
probability density at each point in \code{xvals}.
}
\description{
Output_likelihood() takes the \code{jags_model_run} produced by \code{\link[=run_likelihood]{run_likelihood()}},
merges the mcmc chains and calculates the UPL as well as
providing the predicted pdf and metrics.
