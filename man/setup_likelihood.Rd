\title{Sets up path to JAGS script, initial values, and variable list to monitor}
\usage{
setup_likelihood(
  distribution,
  data,
  manual_prior = FALSE,
  prior_list = NULL,
  random = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{any of c('Normal','Gamma','Skewed','Lognormal','Beta').}

\item{data}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers,
must have a column named 'emissions'.}

\item{manual_prior}{Default is FALSE, if priors should be specified manually
or be uninformative calculated from range of emissions data.}

\item{prior_list}{Optional list of dunif() upper and lower bounds for prior
distributions. For normal they are ordered c(sd_low, sd_high, mean_low, mean_high).
For lognormal they are ordered c(log_sd_low, log_sd_high, log_mean_low, log_mean_high).
For skewed they are ordered c(omega_low, omega_high, xi_low, xi_high, alpha_low, alpha_high).
For gamma they are ordered c(rate_low, rate_high, shape_low, shape_high). For
beta they are ordered c(alpha_low, alpha_high, beta_low, beta_high).}

\item{random}{Default is FALSE where random seeds are defined via .RNG.name
and .RNG.seed so JAGS runs will be reproducible. Changing to TRUE will use
random values for .RNG.name and .RNG.seed instead.}
}
\value{
object model_code, which is a string for the written R script that
JAGS can call, par_list which is the list of parameters traced while running
the JAGS model, dat_inits which is a list of initial parameter values and
random seeds for 3 chains, and the distribution used in likelihood model.
}
\description{
This function defines the jagsmodel script to call based on the selected
distribution. It also defines the initial values and variables to monitor.
