\title{Sets up path to JAGS script, initial values, and variable list to monitor}
\usage{
setup_likelihood(distribution, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{any of c('Normal','Gamma','Skewed','Lognormal','Beta').}

\item{data}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers,
must have a column named 'emissions'.}
}
\value{
object model_code, which is a string for the written R script that
JAGS can call, par_list which is the list of parameters traced while running
the JAGS model, dat_inits which is a list of initial parameter values and
random seeds for 3 chains, and the distribution used in likelihood model.
}
\description{
This function defines the jagsmodel script to call based on the selected
distribution. It also defines the initial values and variables to monitor.
