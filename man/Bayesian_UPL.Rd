\title{Bayesian_UPL() wraps setup_likelihood(), run_likelihood(), and output_likelihood()}
\usage{
Bayesian_UPL(
  data,
  distr_list = c("Normal", "Skewed", "Lognormal", "Gamma", "Beta"),
  future_tests = 3,
  significance = 0.99,
  xvals = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers, must have a column named 'emissions'.}

\item{distr_list}{any of c('Normal','Skewed','Lognormal','Gamma','Beta') distributions}

\item{future_tests}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default is 3 since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}

\item{significance}{Level of significance from 0 to 1, the default is 0.99.}

\item{xvals}{ordered sequence of emissions at which to predict probability density. Default is NULL, in which case x_hat is a 1024 length sequence between 0 and 3*max(data$emissions)}
}
\value{
A list of results from output_likelihood() for run_likelihood() using each distribution in distr_list.
}
\description{
For each distribution in distr_list Bayesian_UPL() will setup_likelihood(), run_likelihood(), and concatenate a list of results from output_likelihood() including the 'predicted_mean' the mean of the fitted distribution, 'UPL_Bayes' the upper predictive limit based on the 'significance' level and average distribution of 'future_tests' number of draws, 'obs_pdf' the predicted probability density at each observation, and 'pred_pdf' the predicted probability density at each point in xvals.
