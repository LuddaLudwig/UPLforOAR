\title{Bayesian_UPL() wraps setup_likelihood(), run_likelihood(),
output_likelihood(), converge_likelihood(), and fit_likelihood()}
\usage{
Bayesian_UPL(
  data,
  future_tests = 3,
  significance = 0.99,
  xvals = NULL,
  distr_list = c("Normal", "Skewed", "Lognormal", "Gamma", "Beta"),
  convergence_report = FALSE,
  manual_prior = FALSE,
  prior_list = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers,
must have a column named 'emissions'.}

\item{future_tests}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default
is 3 since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}

\item{significance}{Level of significance from 0 to 1, the default is 0.99.}

\item{xvals}{ordered sequence of emissions at which to predict probability
density. Default is NULL, in which case x_hat is a 1024 length sequence
between 0 and 3*max(data$emissions)}

\item{distr_list}{any of c('Normal','Skewed','Lognormal','Gamma','Beta')}

\item{convergence_report}{Default is FALSE, if a report containing
convergence figures should be generated with results. If TRUE, a document
Bayesian_UPL_convergence_MMDDYYY_HHMM.pdf will be written to the current
working directory.}

\item{manual_prior}{Default is FALSE, if priors should be specified manually
or be uninformative calculated from range of emissions data. Note that if you
are supplying priors manually than you can only run one type of distribution
at a time.}

\item{prior_list}{Optional list of dunif() upper and lower bounds for prior
distributions. For normal they are ordered c(sd_low, sd_high, mean_low, mean_high).
For lognormal they are ordered c(log_sd_low, log_sd_high, log_mean_low, log_mean_high).
For skewed they are ordered c(omega_low, omega_high, xi_low, xi_high, alpha_low, alpha_high).
For gamma they are ordered c(rate_low, rate_high, shape_low, shape_high). For
beta they are ordered c(alpha_low, alpha_high, beta_low, beta_high).}
}
\value{
A list of results from output_likelihood(), fit_likelihood,
and converge_likelihood() for run_likelihood()
using each distribution in distr_list.
}
\description{
For each distribution in distr_list Bayesian_UPL() will setup_likelihood(),
run_likelihood(), test for convergence of likelihood parameters using
converge_likelihood, and concatenate a list of results from output_likelihood()
including the 'predicted_mean' the mean of the fitted distribution,
'UPL_Bayes' the upper predictive limit based on the 'significance' level and
average distribution of 'future_tests' number of draws, 'obs_pdf' the
predicted probability density at each observation, and 'pred_pdf' the
predicted probability density at each point in xvals. Then fit_likelihood will
add calculations of fit metrics to each distribution result.
