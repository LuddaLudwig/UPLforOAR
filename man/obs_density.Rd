\title{Calculates the density of emissions observations}
\usage{
obs_density(data, xvals = NULL, up = Inf, low = 0, kernel = "gamma", bw = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers,
must have a column named 'emissions'.}

\item{xvals}{Ordered sequence of emissions to define emission densities along.
Default is NULL, in which case xvals is a 1024 length sequence.
between 0 and 3*max(data$emissions)}

\item{up}{Optional upper limit to bound density, default is Inf.}

\item{low}{Optional lower limit to bound density, default is 0.}

\item{kernel}{Kernel choice for density function, default is 'gamma' defined
on (0,Inf). Other options include.
c("gaussian1","gaussian2","beta1","beta2","fb","fbl","fbu","rigaussian")}

\item{bw}{Optional bandwidth, default is NULL in which case
bw = sd(emissions)*n^(-2/5), where n is number of emissions.}
}
\value{
A list containing two tibbles, Obs_onPoint with exact emission
observations and densities, and obs_den_df with densities for every
position given in xvals.
