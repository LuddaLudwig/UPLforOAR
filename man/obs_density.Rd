\title{Calculates the density of emissions observations}
\usage{
obs_density(dataset, xvals, up = Inf, low = 0, kernel = "gamma", bw = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers, must have a column named 'emissions'}

\item{xvals}{ordered sequence of emissions to define emission densities along.}

\item{up}{optional upper limit to bound density, default is Inf.}

\item{low}{optional lower limit to bound density, default is 0.}

\item{kernel}{kernel choice for density function, default is 'gamma' defined on (0,Inf). Other options include c("gaussian1","gaussian2","beta1","beta2","fb","fbl","fbu","rigaussian")}

\item{bw}{optional bandwidth, default is NULL in which case bw = sd(emissions)*n^(-2/5), where n is number of emissions.}
}
\value{
a list containing two tibbles, Obs_onPoint with exact emission observations and densities, and obs_den_df with densities for every position given in xvals.
