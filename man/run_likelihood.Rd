\title{Runs JAGS model scripts for chosen likelihood}
\usage{
run_likelihood(model_input, xvals = NULL, maxY = NULL, future_runs = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_input}{Results from \code{\link[=setup_likelihood]{setup_likelihood()}}, including JAGS model
script, emissions data, distribution, initial values list, and parameters to
monitor.}

\item{xvals}{Ordered sequence of emissions at which to predict probability
density. Default is \code{NULL}, in which case \code{x_hat} is a 1024 length
sequence between \code{0} and \code{3*max(data$emissions)}.}

\item{maxY}{The maximum emission value possible, used to truncate likelihood
distributions and set upper ranges on prior distributions.
Default is \code{NULL}, in which cas it is calculated as \code{3*maximum(data$emissions)}.}

\item{future_runs}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default
is \code{3} since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}
}
\value{
\code{runjags} object named \code{run_results}, likelihood distribution from the
JAGS model script, as well as \code{data} and \code{xval}s used as inputs.
}
\description{
Runs the JAGS model from \code{\link[=setup_likelihood]{setup_likelihood()}} model_code output.
Traces all variables in \code{par_list} running 3 chains in parallel with \code{burnin} and
\code{adapt} of 10,000 each and keeping 10,000 iterations per chain.
