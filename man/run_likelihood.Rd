\title{Runs JAGS model scripts for chosen likelihood}
\usage{
run_likelihood(xvals = NULL, model_input, future_tests = 3, maxY = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xvals}{ordered sequence of emissions at which to predict probability density. Default is NULL, in which case x_hat is a 1024 length sequence between 0 and 3*max(data$emissions)}

\item{model_input}{results from setup_likelihood(), including JAGS model script, emissions data, distribution, initial values list, and parameters to monitor.}

\item{future_tests}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default is 3 since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}

\item{maxY}{The maximum emission value possible, used to truncate likelihood distributions and set upper ranges on prior distributions. Default is 3*maximum(data$emissions).}
}
\value{
runjags object named run_results, likelihood distribution from the JAGS model script, as well as data and xvals used as inputs.
}
\description{
Runs the JAGS model from setup_likelihood() model_code output. Traces all variables in par_list running 3 chains in parallel with burnin and adapt of 10,000 each and keeping 10,000 iterations per chain.
