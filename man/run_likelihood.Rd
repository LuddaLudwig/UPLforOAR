\title{Runs JAGS model scripts for chosen likelihood}
\usage{
run_likelihood(model_input, xvals = NULL, maxY = NULL, future_tests = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_input}{Results from setup_likelihood(), including JAGS model
script, emissions data, distribution, initial values list, and parameters to
monitor.}

\item{xvals}{Ordered sequence of emissions at which to predict probability
density. Default is NULL, in which case x_hat is a 1024 length
sequence between 0 and 3*max(data$emissions).}

\item{maxY}{The maximum emission value possible, used to truncate likelihood
distributions and set upper ranges on prior distributions.
Default is 3*maximum(data$emissions).}

\item{future_tests}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default
is 3 since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}
}
\value{
runjags object named run_results, likelihood distribution from the
JAGS model script, as well as data and xvals used as inputs.
}
\description{
Runs the JAGS model from setup_likelihood() model_code output.
Traces all variables in par_list running 3 chains in parallel with burnin and
adapt of 10,000 each and keeping 10,000 iterations per chain.
