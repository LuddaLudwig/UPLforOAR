\title{fit_likelihood() calculates the error between fitted density and
observed density distributions}
\usage{
fit_likelihood(likelihood_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{likelihood_result}{Output list from \code{\link[=output_likelihood]{output_likelihood()}}}
}
\value{
The sum of squared error (SSE) between predicted and observed
probability densities, and the count of emissions whose 95\\% CI around
predicted probability densities overlaps observed probability densities.
Also includes the integration of predicted pdf, distribution type used, and
merged data sets of observed and predicted densities at each emission value
and each \code{xval}, named \code{obs_pdf_dat} and \code{xhat_pdf_dat} respectively. The
\code{obs_pdf_dat} also includes the upper and lower 95\\% and median around predicted
pdf. The UPL estimate from \code{\link[=output_likelihood]{output_likelihood()}} is included as well.
}
\description{
This function takes the list of results from \code{\link[=output_likelihood]{output_likelihood()}} and compares
the predicted density distributions to observed density distributions,
estimating the \code{SSE} (sum of squared errors) and counts the number of emissions
observations with densities that have overlapping 95\\% CI with predicted densities.
