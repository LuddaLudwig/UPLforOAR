\title{Calculate UPL assuming lognormally distributed emissions data}
\usage{
Lognormal_UPL(dataset, future_tests = 3, significance = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers, must have a column named 'emissions'}

\item{future_tests}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default is 3 since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}

\item{significance}{Level of significance from 0 to 1, the default is 0.99.}
}
\value{
upper predictive limit at significance level for the average of the number of future test runs
}
