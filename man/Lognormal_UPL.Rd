\title{Calculate UPL assuming lognormally distributed emissions data}
\usage{
Lognormal_UPL(data, future_tests = 3, significance = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Emissions data from either the best source or top performers,
must have a column named 'emissions'}

\item{future_tests}{Integer of future runs to use in prediction, the default
is 3 since compliance uses 1 test average of 3 runs.}

\item{significance}{Level of significance from 0 to 1, the default is 0.99.}
}
\value{
Upper predictive limit at significance level for the average of the
number of future test runs
}
\description{
Uses Gram-Charlmier Series-A distribution approximation to determine the
lognormal UPL.
