\title{Writes likelihood scripts for JAGS model calls}
\usage{
write_likelihood(distribution, manual_prior = FALSE, write_wd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{Any of 'Normal', 'Gamma', 'Skewed', 'Lognormal', or 'Beta'.}

\item{manual_prior}{Default is FALSE, if priors should be specified manually
or be uninformative calculated from range of emissions data.}

\item{write_wd}{Default is NULL, in which case the JAGS scripts are written
into inst/JAGS folder in package directory. This is the location
run_likelihood() will look for the JAGS scripts assigned via setup_likelihood().}
}
\value{
object model_code, which is a string for the written R script that
JAGS can call and the distribution used in likelihood model.
}
\description{
This function writes an R script for JAGS to call based on the selected
distribution and prior. The priors are uninformative and
set based on emissions data, unless specified manually via setup_likelihood().
The likelihood distributions are truncated to (0,maxY), where maxY can be
specified or used with the default maxY=3*max(data$emissions) in run_likelihood().
