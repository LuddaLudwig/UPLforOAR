\title{Writes likelihood scripts for JAGS model calls}
\usage{
write_likelihood(distribution, manual_prior = FALSE, write_wd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{any of c('Normal','Gamma','Skewed','Lognormal','Beta').}

\item{manual_prior}{Default is FALSE, if priors should be specified manually
or be uninformative calculated from range of emissions data.}

\item{write_wd}{default is NULL, in which case the JAGS scripts are written
into inst/JAGS folder in package directory}
}
\value{
object model_code, which is a string for the written R script that
JAGS can call and the distribution used in likelihood model.
}
\description{
This function writes an R script for JAGS to call based on the selected distribution and prior. The initial values and priors are uninformative and set based on emissions data. The likelihood distributions are truncated to (0,3*max(data$emissions))
}
