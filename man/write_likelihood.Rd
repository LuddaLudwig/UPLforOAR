\title{Writes likelihood scripts for JAGS model calls}
\usage{
write_likelihood(distribution, manual_prior = FALSE, write_wd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{Any of \code{'Normal'}, \code{'Gamma'}, \code{'Skewed'}, \code{'Lognormal'}, or \code{'Beta'}.}

\item{manual_prior}{Default is \code{FALSE}, if priors should be specified manually
or be uninformative calculated from range of emissions data.}

\item{write_wd}{Default is \code{NULL}, in which case the JAGS scripts are written
into inst/JAGS folder in package directory. This is the location
\code{\link[=run_likelihood]{run_likelihood()}} will look for the JAGS scripts assigned via \code{\link[=setup_likelihood]{setup_likelihood()}}.}
}
\value{
object \code{model_code}, which is a string for the written R script that
JAGS can call and the distribution used in likelihood model.
}
\description{
This function writes an R script for JAGS to call based on the selected
distribution and prior. The priors are uninformative and
set based on emissions data, unless specified manually via \code{\link[=setup_likelihood]{setup_likelihood()}}.
The likelihood distributions are truncated to \verb{(0,maxY)}, where \code{maxY} can be
specified or used with the default \code{maxY = 3*max(data$emissions)} in \code{\link[=run_likelihood]{run_likelihood()}}.
