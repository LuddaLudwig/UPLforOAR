## Welcome!

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to an EPA open source project! 
If you’re unsure about anything, just ask — or submit your issue or pull request 
anyway. The worst that can happen is we’ll politely ask you to change something. 
We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its 
[LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

All contributions to this project will be released under the MIT dedication. 
By submitting a pull request or issue, you are agreeing to comply with this 
waiver of copyright interest.

Contributions to development of the package are welcome and encouraged. Please 
consider the following guidelines for contributing to `UPLforOAR`:
- We encourage package users to submit bugs and enhancement requests by 
submitting issues - see the [Quickstart for GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart) 
page if you are new to GitHub issues
- Contributions should use the standard GitHub 
[fork - pull-request workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)
- We encourage use of the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) 
for contributions
- Contributions should ideally be tested using 
[testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)
- Make sure you use roxygen and run check() before contributing
- If you contribute to documentation, running `devtools::document()` will 
refresh the help docs
